WISHFUL THINKING:

If you had to imagine the source that would fill this gap in your story, what would it tell you?

If this idea was a part of a building, what would it be?

* foundation
* structural steel (girders, I-beams)
* wall studs
* flooring
* paint/wallpaper
* roof
* parking lot
* heating / air conditioning
* the parking lot

(That is to say, is this idea essential? Is it merely nice to have? Is it merely cosmetic window-dressing? Is it peripheral?)

WHEN YOU'RE STUCK:

Think of this piece of writing like a car you're taking on a trip.

Is the problem here with the frame, the engine, the turn signals, or the paint?
(Or the driver? If so, go exercise and eat.)

* Do I have a map?
* Do the headlights work?
* Is the road paved?
